# Text Crop

I've recently come across this article https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/cropping-away-negative-impacts-of-line-height-84d744e016ce. Basically it's a solution for cropping out the white space in text elements produced by line-height.

In this React project I've translated the utility function in the article for use with styled-components. This comes very useful for laying out UIs with with precision.
